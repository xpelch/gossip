# Gossip v2 production acceptance policy

Status: approved as written. These values are active production-acceptance
criteria, but they remain unmeasured and are not release claims.

## Release decision

The first public Gossip v2 release accepts public evidence only. Private
submission remains disabled and is reported as `blocked`, with no private payload
accepted, retained, exported, or included in telemetry. Enabling private evidence
later requires a separate approved policy for retention, legal hold, deletion,
access audit, key rotation, backup erasure, and incident response.

Public submission still requires explicit approval of the exact content and a
warning before publishing a linkable identity, source, or content commitment.
Feedback remains disabled until its scoped authorization and server capability
pass separate acceptance.

## Proposed service objectives

Request latency is measured at the public HTTPS boundary from complete request
receipt to complete response. Event latency is measured between the named persisted
events in each objective. Deterministic policy refusals are counted separately from
availability failures and must never be removed from reports.

No percentile is reported with fewer than 100 eligible observations across the two
windows, with at least 50 in each window. Report the sample count, time window,
client region, server revision, deployment ID, and excluded deterministic refusal
count beside every result. Bind each window to the exact Gossip artifact, Sherwood
revision, receipt trust manifest, protocol, schema, authentication, and MCP
revisions, and content-address its result summary.

Consultation availability counts a schema-valid authenticated 2xx response with a
complete result, or a protocol-allowed partial result carrying an authentic receipt,
before the 20-second client deadline. A timeout, transport or TLS error, 5xx,
schema-invalid response, or missing or invalid required receipt is a failure.
Deterministic authentication, authorization, policy, and contract refusals are
reported separately and excluded from this availability denominator.

## Promotion measurement

Run two independent 30-minute windows against the exact candidate deployment and
attested package. Each window must include at least:

- 200 signed capability discoveries;
- 100 standard zero-cost consultations across at least 10 synthetic identities;
- 100 exact retries and 100 changed-content conflicts;
- 50 controlled reconciliation cases spanning restart and persistence cut points;
- 20 owner-isolation attempts;
- 50 controlled source-divergence cases;
- 50 controlled reorg cases;
- 50 accepted corrections that supersede visible evidence;
- 100 intentionally replayed nonce/signature pairs; and
- one restart, session rotation, revocation, upgrade, and rollback journey per
  advertised host.

The release fails if either window misses an objective, any prohibited secret or
private payload appears in capture, or any result cannot be tied to the exact
package, deployment, trust manifest, protocol, schema, authentication, and MCP
revisions.

This approval activates the measurement criteria. It does not assert that any
objective has passed, approve private submissions, or set a production
acceptance flag.
