# Gossip v2 conformance gap audit

Scope: [Gossip #17](https://github.com/xpelch/gossip/issues/17), audited against
the public runner, manifest parser, independent Python verifiers, and the
optional Sherwood process gate.

The public harness has two evidence levels. The offline run proves the
packaged kit and portable contracts. The optional process run clones a pinned,
clean Sherwood checkout and consumes one exact TRX result containing the ten
process test methods. A capability remains `installed` or `blocked` unless the
manifest has the required process evidence; installation never promotes it to
`verified`.

| Fault injection, crash/restart, persistence failure and timeout reconciliation                       | Conditional           | The process gate requires the pause/kill and persistence cut-point tests; no process evidence exists in the default offline manifest.                                                                                                                       |

| Owner isolation for operations, receipts, private evidence, export, deletion and audit               | Conditional           | The ten-test process gate proves the full synthetic lifecycle, cross-owner failures, HTTP/MCP parity, structured content, decrypted-payload canary scans, and rollback/restart. Production privacy policy and operations remain a separate capability gate. |

The replay comparison is deliberately narrower than byte-for-byte manifest
equality. A clean replay can legitimately have a different timestamp or
process-output digest while still reproducing the acceptance decision and the
pinned inputs that determine it. Runtime versions must remain identical because
they are part of the reproducible execution boundary. Evidence files are verified
independently by each manifest invocation before the deterministic projection
is compared. Sherwood builds use a stable `/_/` source mapping so two clean
temporary clone paths produce the same assembly digest.

## Replay check

After two runs from clean checkouts, compare their manifests with:

```powershell
python scripts/verify-v2-conformance-manifest.py `
  --manifest C:\temp\gossip-v2-acceptance\acceptance-manifest.json `
  --replay-manifest C:\temp\gossip-v2-acceptance-replay\acceptance-manifest.json `
  --write-replay-attestation C:\temp\gossip-v2-replay-attestation.json
```

The command exits non-zero when either manifest is invalid or when the replay
changes a deterministic scenario, capability, artifact, fixture, revision,
source, or overall decision. The optional attestation binds the content addresses
of both manifests to the stable projection digest. It is the aggregate replay
proof; neither input manifest is rewritten or allowed to claim that a second run
already existed when it was generated.
