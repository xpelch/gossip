# `setup-gossip` preview workflow

`setup-gossip` is the orchestration entry point for preparing a Gossip agent.
It is a developer preview, not proof that Grok Bot, Hermes, OpenClaw, a public
endpoint, standards interoperability, RPC access, or trading is supported in a
particular environment. The command reports runtime, wallet, host integration,
Gossip connection, RPC, standards, and trading readiness independently.

Use a pinned checkout and an absolute state directory. Read the repository
instructions before running it, use the checked-in Linux bootstrap where
applicable, and never execute an unpinned fetched script:

```text
node dist/cli.js setup-gossip --host hermes --directory ABSOLUTE_STATE
```

The host value is one of `grok-bot`, `hermes`, or `openclaw`. Pass
`--config ABSOLUTE_HOST_CONFIG` for host configuration and
`--skills-directory ABSOLUTE_DIRECTORY` to install the `setup-gossip` and
`gossip` skills. Skill installation preserves unrelated files and refuses
conflicts. Grok Bot MCP loading remains unverified; a terminal fallback must
be labeled as such.

Wallet selection is performed before endpoint or RPC setup:

```text
node dist/cli.js setup-gossip --host hermes --wallet create --directory ABSOLUTE_STATE
node dist/cli.js setup-gossip --host hermes --wallet reuse --directory ABSOLUTE_STATE
node dist/cli.js setup-gossip --host hermes --wallet attach-file --file ABSOLUTE_FILE --format raw-hex --address CHECKSUM --directory EMPTY_STATE
```

Creating a wallet requires supported protected storage. Reuse preserves the
existing identity. File attachment accepts exactly `raw-hex`, `json-privateKey`,
or `json-private_key`; use the selected value in `--format`. It uses a trusted local host helper and does
not copy a secret into the Gossip profile, Secret Service, model context, logs,
arguments, configuration, or server requests. The source remains owned by the
user, its checksum address is verified, and unsupported external-provider,
recovery-phrase, or contract-wallet APIs stop with a named blocker.

Network setup is explicit and happens after the wallet branch:

```text
node dist/cli.js setup-gossip --host hermes --network configure --rpc https://robinhood-rpc.publicnode.com --directory ABSOLUTE_STATE
node dist/cli.js setup-gossip --host hermes --network check --directory ABSOLUTE_STATE
node dist/cli.js setup-gossip --host hermes --endpoint https://ENGINE/mcp --audience https://ENGINE --directory ABSOLUTE_STATE
```

`--endpoint` and `--audience` attempt signed connection verification.
`setup-gossip` accepts `--profile gossip-eip191-v2` to select the signed v2
engine and six-tool bridge; legacy setup remains the default. It continues to
orchestrate wallet, host, and RPC readiness and
leaves a missing endpoint connection pending. RPC configuration validates
HTTPS, chain 4663, fresh block reads and timeouts; retain a working explicit RPC
and report a failing one before any replacement.

Hermes and OpenClaw require a real documented configuration path and additive
conflict-safe host installation. Grok Bot MCP loading remains unverified; use a
documented terminal fallback only when available and label it as such.

For RPC readiness, retain a working configured provider after validating HTTPS,
chain ID 4663, fresh block reads, timeout behavior, and sanitized credentials.
With no configured provider, test `https://robinhood-rpc.publicnode.com`; its
availability is not guaranteed. RPC readiness is independent of legacy Gossip
identity setup. Gossip connection requires the actual HTTPS endpoint and
audience plus a successful signed `agent_access` response; no localhost example
is a deployed service.

Report each standard independently. Installing a client library is not verifier
or engine interoperability. Trading stays disabled unless a verified DEX and
bounded, explicitly authorized wallet policy pass balance, quote, simulation,
allowance, gas, and signing checks. Setup must not fund, approve, broadcast,
register, or broaden permissions.

The local trading preview is explicit and single-trade scoped:

```text
node dist/cli.js trade quote --address WALLET --token-in TOKEN --token-out TOKEN --amount-in BASE_UNITS --fee 3000 --slippage-bps 100 --deadline-seconds 300 --directory ABSOLUTE_STATE
node dist/cli.js trade authorize --quote /absolute/quote.json --id STABLE_ID --gas-limit MAX --max-fee-wei MAX --directory ABSOLUTE_STATE
node dist/cli.js trade execute --id STABLE_ID --directory ABSOLUTE_STATE
node dist/cli.js trade revoke --directory ABSOLUTE_STATE
```

Quotes output unsigned JSON. Authorization requires an interactive terminal
`CONFIRM`, is for one trade, and is never standing autonomous permission. Local
managed EOAs and explicitly attached local-file keys are read only inside
trusted local code; Gossip does not custody them. Exact-amount approval is
allowed only when current allowance is zero; nonzero insufficient allowance is
blocked. The execution journal preserves retry identity and reports pending
transactions without creating a new trade. No live DEX swap has been tested;
only official deployment addresses and synthetic local contracts are evidence.

The final report must include evidence, the public wallet address only, and one
concrete next action for every pending facet. Installation never equals a
connected or trading-ready agent.
